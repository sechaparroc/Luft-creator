# Luft-creator

Just a simple tool to create bead patterns. [Try it here.](https://sechaparroc.github.io/Luft-creator-pixel-art-online-editor/)

## Usage

* Use the rows and columns sliders to set the size of the board.
* Select the Brush button and keep the mouse pressed on the board to change the cells color.
* Select the Trash button and keep the mouse pressed on the board to delete undesired cells.
* Click on the Palette buttons (at the bottom of the canvas) to change the brush color.
* Double-click on any of the palette buttons to change the default color for a custom one. A [color picker](https://github.com/Simonwep/pickr) will pop up.
* Use the cell ratio slider to define the aspect of the cell (e.g. for square cells choose a ratio of 1).
* Select the Offset button to apply an offset over a whole row (this is useful for brick stitch patterns).
* Use the load and save buttons to save your work and finish it later.
